cze.179.d:0 "It seems that Jan Rys-Rozsévač has been alerted about our plan and, in a rather smart move, fleed the country. Theories about his potential whereabouts say it's likely he has fled to Germany, or possibly even Hungary. While we don't know where he might be, we do know two things:\nIt's time to finally get rid of the OO.\nAnd there are infiltrated OO traitors amongst our ranks.\n\nThere is some purging to be done."
cze.179.a:0 "What a messy purge it will be."
cze.180.t:0 "Rys-Rozsévač succesfully captured"
cze.180.d:0 "The trap was set. Rys-Rozsévač did not expect a thing. As he proudly walked into the national palace to talk with the Vůdce, our forces immediately stepped up and captured him. He proceeded to insult the Vůdce and, by, consequence, the nation. Typical behavior for a traitor. He was trialed right there and promptly shot.\n\nFollowing this, the OO was declared illegal, and without their leader, the organization began dispersing as any caught agent was arrested and dealt with. The Purge has began."

A different age is about to begin however, one where we build from what Gajda left us, and improve it, to reach the highest peak of human achievement. We will adopt the Czech Way to Valkism!\n\nThus was proclaimed by the new Vůdce Rys-Rozsévač. Many are anxious to see what this will bring to Czechia, though."

cze.191.a:0 "This is great!"
cze.192.t:0 "Slovakia Rejects Detente"
cze.192.d:0 "It seems that the Slovak government, still fueled by a foul mix of spite and nationalism, has decided to reject our friendly offer of detente. It seems like when chaos begins to rain on Europe, we can't even trust in our brothers, any more."
cze.192.a:0 "Their loss."
cze.193.t:0 "Czechia Calls for Czech-Slovak Congress"
cze.193.d:0 "Seeking to further improve the relations between our countries, and possibly cooperate on some matters, the Czech government has called us to establish a Czech-Slovak Congress. An interesting offer, while cooperation is tentative, the thought of Czechia trying to influence us again is still threatening. An interesting choice to make."

cze.195.t:0 "Slovakia Agrees to the Congress"
cze.195.d:0 "Deciding it's in their best interests to seek possible chances to strengthen ties and cooperate with us, and rightfully so, the Slovak government has agreed to the realization of this Czech-Slovak Congress plan. We can only hope everything goes well from now on."
cze.195.a:0 "We can hope."
cze.196.t:0 "The Czech-Slovak Congress begins"
cze.196.d:0 "Organized in the symbolic city of Brno, the long-awaited Congress finally begins. Important diplomats from our nations reunite in the event, as president [Root.GetLeader] gives an speech about the historical ties between our people's, and, of course, moving on from the Czechoslovakia ordeal. He proceeded to shake hands with Slovak president [SLO.GetLeader], in a historical ceremony. Now, the Congress can properly begin."
cze.196.a:0 "For the Peoples of Czechia and Slovakia!"
cze.197.t:0 "The Congress on Economy"
cze.197.d:0 "The first matter on the agenda, economic ties, was put on the spotlight. While Czechia has been able to build a strong economy based on its large industrial base, as well as ties with the stable Entente economical sphere, the Slovaks had had it rougher. With a mainly agrarian economy, it's ties with the British have helped it immensely, and after the London Stock Market Crisis, it has been quite difficult. Nonetheless, with very different productive areas, there is a lot of potential for economical ties and maybe integration.\n\nOne of the proposed ideas, is to begin trading with Slovakia in a complementary fashion, an Agricultural-Industrial kind-of deal. To make this profitable for Slovakia though, we'll need to give them a better trade margin that we do with other trade partners. While this would undoubtly be benefitial for Slovakia, and bring us together, many Czech politicians believe it goes against the best commercial interests of Czechia."
cze.197.a:0 "We'll cooperate economically."
cze.197.b:0 "That's just a bad deal."
cze.198.t:0 "The Congress on Economy"
cze.198.d:0 "The Czech-Slovak Congress began on the matter of Economical Cooperation. Czechia as expected had a stronger weight on the Congress, due to their better economical performance as an independent nation. The matter on the agenda however turned out quite well for us, as the Czechs agreed to benefitial trade margins with us, that will certainly help our economy get forward. It seems the Congress might have been a good idea."
