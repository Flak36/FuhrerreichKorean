austria.1.t:"The Status of Austria"0
austria.1.d: "1914년 오스트리아 제국은 세르비아에 대한 지배를 주장하고 대공의 죽음에 대한 복수를 하기 위해 승리에 대한 높은 희망을 안고 대전에 돌입했습니다. 그러나, 그들은 전선에서 매일 밀려났고, 이러한 사실은 그들에게 좋지 않은 상황임을 의미했습니다. 결국 오스트리아-헝가리 황가를 위한 전쟁이 끝났다는 사실을 제국의 신민들이 깨달았을 때 빈과 부다페스트에서 점점 더 많은 자유주의 정치인들의 목소리가 커졌고 소수민족에 대한 권리는 커져갔습니다. 이러한 일련의 사건들은 군주제에 반대하는 좌파 친(親)민족 정당들의 엄청난 지지 기반을 얻는 것으로 끝났습니다. 전화가 가라앉자 오스트리아는 베르사유 조약으로 난장판이 되었습니다. 11월 11일 카를은 오스트리아 신민이 국가의 형태를 결정하는 것을 인정하는 내용의 선엄문을 조심스레 발표했습니다. 카를은 또한 오스트리아 국정에 참여할 권리를 포기했습니다. 그는 또한 람마스크와 그의 내각을 공직에서 해임하고, 황제에 대한 충성 서약에서 제국의 반쪽인 오스트리아의 관리들을 놓아주었습니다. 이틀 후, 그는 헝가리에 대해서도 비슷한 선언을 했습니다. 그러나 카를은 퇴위하지 않았고, 어느 한 곳이라도 국민들이 그를 잊지 않는다면 다시 돌아올 수 있었습니다. 하지만 모든 면에서 볼 때 합스부르크의 통치의 끝이었고. 카를의 퇴위 거부는 사실상 상관이 없었습니다. 오스트리아 정치에서 손을 놓기를 선언한 다음 날, 칼 레너(Karl Renner)가 이끄는 사회민주당과 사회 보수당연합은 독일 오스트리아 공화국을 선포했습니다.  실업보험, 유급휴일, 8시간 근무제, 광부, 제빵사, 여성, 아동 등의 근로조건 규제 등 광범위한 사회개혁이 도입되었습니다. 또한 장애인을 위한 국가 원조는 공무원 의료보험과 함께 제공되었습니다. 또 단체교섭과 분쟁 조정 등을 규정한 법률도 통과됐습니다. 그러나 연대는 오래가지 못했고, 기독사회당은 사회민주당 지도부에 싫증이 나서 연정을 떠났으며, 그 과정에서 기존 사민당에 실망한 극좌 의원들도 탈당해 공산당을 결성했습니다. 집권정부는 소수당이 되었고 1923년 선거가 그 사실에 못을 박아 사회보수당에게 집권당을 넘겨주었습니다. 우익과 좌익의 준군사조직은 20년대에 만들어졌습니다. 애국향우회(Heimvehr, Home Resistance)는 1920년 5월 12일에 처음 등장하여 3년에 걸쳐 점진적으로 조직되었고 이에 대응하여 공화당전위대가 결성되었습니다. 애국향우회는 많은 인기를 얻기 시작했고 1927년 선거에서 그들은 근본적으로 독립된 정당이나 마찬가지였습니다. 보수당은 그들과 연정하는 것을 기회로 여겼습니다. 반면 좌익들은 매우 분열되어 있었기 때문에 선거는 기독사회당과 애국향우회의 결정적인 승리로 끝났습니다.  많은 사람들이 애국향우회를 잔인하고 억압적인 조직으로 보았기 때문에 1927년 선거 결과는 빈 사법부 앞에서 대규모 시위와 화재로 이어졌습니다. 1927년 7월 시위에서 89명의 시위자들이 오스트리아 경찰에 의해 살해당했습니다. 정치적 갈등은 1930년대 초까지 확대되었습니다. 빌헬름 미클라스 대통령에 대한 암살미수 사건은 애국향우회의 영향력을 더욱 강화시켰습니다. 이러한 상황은 오늘날까지 계속되어 왔지만, 독일에서 등장한 발키즘 때문에 많은 젊은이들은 자신들을 독일인으로 생각하기 시작했고, 독일과 합병을 외치는 가운데 좌파들은 붉은 빈 운동에서 받은 지지 외에도 이전의 지지도를 회복하기 위해서는 내부분쟁을 끝내야함을 깨달았습니다"
austria.1.a: "우린 신중하게 선택해야 한다."
austria.2.t: "1937년 선거"
austria.2.d:"After the Great War ended, and Austria became it's own, independent country, a Social Democrat coalition help to modernize and inspire the people of this country, after such a horrific event. However, the coalition quickly fell apart, and the divide became more and more intense, with many parties forming their own paramilitary units. This eventually culminated into a series of political protests, which ended in the lives of 89 protestors dead. Now, the politics of Austria, with the latest election, hang in the balance, and the victory could determine the path Austria is to take for many years to come."
austria.2.a: "The SDAPÖ-KPÖ Coalition"
austria.2.b: "The CSP"
austria.2.c: "The CSP-Heimwehr Coalition"
austria.3.t: "The SDAPO seeks a coalition with the KPO"
austria.3.d: "In light of the recent election, the SDAPO is seeking a coalition with a fellow socialist party, the KPO, to help both increase popularity and backing for Socialist ideals in Austria, and to hopefully beat out the other reactionaries and conservatives."
austria.3.a: "An agreement issn't reached, the coalition isn't formed."
austria.3.b: "The SDAPO and KPO agree to form a Coalition."
austria.4.t: "The Status of the Coalition"
austria.4.d: "In the recent elections, the SDAPO and KPO stand at odds with each other, based on their different Socialist platforms. As of right now, the SDAPO can decide to go solo, or try to compromise and agree to some reforms with the KPO. The KPO, if lucky enough, could also gain a majortiy, and come out triumphant"
austria.4.a: "The SDAPÖ respects the Coalition and agrees to some reforms.
austria.4.b: "The SDAPÖ rules alone!"
austria.4.c: "The KPÖ gains a majority!"
austria.5.t: "The Crackdown on Valkists & German agitators"
austria.5.d: "Ever since [GER.GetLeader] came to power in Germany, his fanatical cries to unite all Germans has long since threatened the sovreignty and existence of our nation. Unfortunately, these ideals shouted by Adam Dressler have struck a cord with many of the Valkists and Germans within our area, and they continue to be a threat to our stability and prosperity. We must crackdown on these people to eliminate any threats to our nation, and so we can continue to exist as one."
austria.5.a: "Put them back behind bars!"
austria.6.t: "Mounting dissent from the Radical-Left"
austria.6.d: "Ever since the results of the last election, the radical leftist members have vehemently opposed them and us. This has lead to numerous protest, riots, and other forms of political aggression throughout the countryside. However, at the present time, there is nothing we can do about this strain on our politics."
austria.6.a: "Worrying, to say the least"
austria.7.t: "KPÖ Riots in Wien!"
austria.7.d: "Things are not looking good for us so far. The dissent among the radicals has only increased further and further as the days have been passing by. Today, we are seeing a first hand example of that. In Wien, our glorious capital, the local members of the KPO have surrounded our parliament building, and are currently holding a massive riot. It appears that in grave situations like these, we can only use the most extreme of measures."
austria.7.a: "Deploy the Army!"
austria.8.t: "The Sozialnationalistische Coup"
austria.8.d: "After the deployment of the Army at the protest, the Austrian people have been growing only more and more paranoid of them, and fear they might drive the country to civil war. The nationalists have thus, taken power, to ensure stability within the country, and crush the Radicals once and for all."
austria.8.a: "Our nation must be protected from the godless Leftists!"
austria.9.t: "The Austrian Civil War"
austria.9.d: "It appears that all of our attempts to stop an uprising amongst the Socialists has unfortunately, failed. After the national populists took power in our country, this only angered the leftist radicals even more, and now various militias and workers unions have taken control of various areas throughout the country. The worst has now arrived for our nation. We must now decide how to proceed from here."
austria.9.a:0 "We cannot handle this on our own; unify with Germany!"
austria.9.b:0 "We'll put these Socialists down ourselves!"
austria.10.t:0 "Austrians request Unification"
austria.10.d:0 "Among many of our citizens, they seem to be quite apathetic towards fighting and participating in the civil war all by themselves. Many of them feel that we are too outnumbered by them, and that simply the best course of action would be to unite with the Valkist Reich, so in the end, we can secure peace and stability for the Austrian people, no matter what"
austria.10.a:0 "Accept, and we'll make an example of these Collectivist revolters."
austria.10.b:0 "Decline, Socialists are scary. Austria is on their own."
austria.11.t:0 "Mounting dissent from the Moderate-Left"
austria.11.d:0 "As the days pass, it seems it's not only the radicals who aren't satisfied with the current state of our government. Now, we are seeing an increased amount of dissent, and unrest from these specific moderate groups, which have only cause futher instability and trouble for us."
austria.11.a:0 "Concerning."
austria.12.t:0 "Industrialization of Austria"
austria.12.d:0 "Recently, we have seen an increasing amounts of threats from countries around us, such as Germany and Hungary. Many citizens and politicians alike think that we should, for the time being, invest the good number of our resources into the industry in order to both increase our nations prosperity, as well as security. However, there are some other politicians, who believe that the money could be better spent elsewhere, like our military, or various other projects. Should we risk angering this small minority of politicians?"
austria.12.a:0 "Pass the Act."
austria.12.b:0 "That's unnessecary and controversial."
austria.13.t:0 "Unrest in the countryside"
austria.13.d:0 "As the days are passing bye, things are not getting much better for Austria. The amount of political unrest has gone from not only the cities, but to the countryside and various rural areas as well. It seems that in this time, no Austrian, regardless of wealth, status, or location, is safe from the conflict."
austria.13.a:0 "Not much can be done about that, unfortunately."
austria.14.t:0 "Heimwehr gains traction"
austria.14.d:0 "Among the new political crisis that is occuring within our country, an old enemy has come back strong. The old conservative paramilitary organisation, the Heimwehr, has come back, stronger and more popular then ever. It's status as a reactionary, paramilitary organisation, has for the longest time been a threat to our government. But now, this is even more the case. With their increase popularity and power, we must tread carefully."
austria.14.a:0 "We cannot let Reactionary Dogs challenge us! Crush them!"
austria.15.t:0 "Heimwehr storms the Federal Council!"
austria.15.d:0 "Terror has struck today! The Heimwehr has, for the longest time, been the biggest of threats to us, and our attempts to drive them out have been highly unsuccessful. However, the worst has come, as today, they have stormed and taken control of our Federal Council. We are unsure of what will happen next, but we are sure it won't be pretty..."
austria.15.a:0 "I am the Federal Council!"
austria.16.t:0 "The Austrian Civil War"
austria.16.d:0 "After the Heimwehr seized power in Austria, it caused a brief, but big enough opportunity for the leftist parties to rise up in opposition to what would become the new, reactionary government. The Heimwehr now stands at a crossroads as to what actions it should take. "
austria.16.a:0 "The Heimwehr attempts to Unify with Germany!"
austria.16.b:0 "The Heimwehr decides to fight by themselves!"
austria.17.t:0 "Skirmishes with the Heimwehr"
austria.17.d:0 "In an attempt to put an end to this paramilitary organization, we have deployed our armed forces in area where we have noticed high amounts of Heimwehr activity. Unfortunately for us, these engagements have ended in severe disaster for us, and our government has lost support due to the amount of lives lost in these fatal engagements."
austria.17.a:0 "Blast!"
austria.18.t:0 "Cracking down on the Heimwehr & Valkists"
austria.18.t:0 "After we have finally secured our government, we must at last put an end to the few that remain of the reactionary forces. No longer shall they try to stop the plight of the working man, and hold back the nation of Austria."
austria.18.a:0 "This surely won't result in any repercussions."
austria.19.t:0 "Purging the Social-Nationalists"
austria.19.d:0 "The Reactionaries, are, however, not the only threat to our government. The radical elements and nationalists of Austria could become even more and more dangerous, if left unchecked, and could cause increasing instability for us in the future. We must rid them from our cabinet, so this will never happen to us."
austria.19.a:0 "The radicals must be put down!"
austria.20.t:0 "Purging the Austro-Marxists"
austria.20.d:0 "Even within our own faction, we see constant infighting. We are all Socialists, but alas, we aren't united in solidarity. Many of them hold different beliefs in how to carry out an economy that is best suited for the proletariat, and the Austro-Marxists are certainly examples of this. In order to create the ideal society in our image, they must be removed."
austria.20.a:0 "The radicals must be put down!"
austria.21.t:0 "Heimwehr riots across the nation!"
austria.21.d:0 "Damn the Heimwehr! It appears that even after our purges, there were some clever remnants who managed to elude us. Now, they have re-organized, and have gained more and more popularity. They have now inspired mass riots across all of Austria!"
austria.21.a:0 "Oh god how awful how could I have anticipated dissent from the people I purged, that's crazy"
austria.22.t:0 "Austria in Disarray"
austria.22.d:0 "Riots have broken out all across our fallen brother, Austria. This would be an opportune moment to intervene and unite our nations as they were always meant to be."
austria.22.a:0 "Intervene and attempt to occupy Austria."
austria.22.b:0 "We cannot risk angering the Entente."
austria.23.t:0 "German forces move into Austria!"
austria.23.d:0 "We've just received reports that German forces have moved across the Danube. Under normal circumstances this would mean war, but we are in a most dire situation. Perhaps surrendering would be the best option?"
austria.23.a:0 "We cannot resist... We are broken..."
austria.23.b:0 "If they want our land, they'll have to fight us!"
austria.24.t:0 "Successful occupation"
austria.24.d:0 "Austria has successfully been secured! People all around the country now hail Dressler as their "Führer" and sing praises to the Fatherland."
austria.24.a:0 "We are one step closer to Uniting the German people!"
austria.25.t:0 "Austrian resistance!"
austria.25.d:0 "The Austrians have decided that they would rather face German steel than surrender. They hold a strong defensive position in the Alps, but surely this wouldn't be enough to stop the onslaught of the German army."
austria.25.a:0 "Crush the Austrians! This means WAR!"
austria.25.b:0 "Withdraw our troops! Call off the operation!"
austria.26.t:0 "Negotiating with the Valkists"
austria.27.d:0 "We have decided to start negotiations with the Valkists. During these negotiations it will be crucial to gain a mutual understanding of what the future should hold for our nation."
austria.26.a:0 "Only through understanding can differences be settled."
austria.27.t:0 "Cracking down on the Austromarxists"
austria.27.d:0 "We have recently deployed the Heimwehr to various known hiding places for the Austromarxists. We will no longer tolerate these leeches feeding off of our great nation!"
austria.27.a:0 "I was lying about being understanding to the opposition."
austria.28.t:0 "Status of the Heimwehr"
austria.28.d:0 "The Heimwehr was created to keep order and serve as a standing army in case of emergency. However, it is time to decide whether it should serve a greater purpose than this."
austria.28.a:0 "The Heimwehr is designated as the National Police Force."
austria.28.b:0 "The Heimatblock gains a majority in the Coalition."
austria.28.c:0 "They Co-rule with the CSP."
austria.29.t:0 "Failed Valkist Coup"
austria.29.d:0 "This morning, a convoy smuggling weapons across the border was stopped. The vehicle and crew were Germans of the Valkist Reich to our north. These men led us to a secret meeting place where various valkist conspirators were planning a Coup D'etat to take control of our nation and unite with the Germans."
austria.29.a:0 "We tried to be understanding with you..."
austria.30.t:0 "Leftist uprisings across the Nation!"
austria.30.d:0 "Early this morning, with what started a simple strike for better working conditions soon spread beyond all belief to a massive, nation-wide uprising of the left. This must be dealt with and fast."
austria.30.a:0 "Blast!"
austria.31.t:0 "The Austrian Civil War"
austria.31.d:0 "With our country on the brink of total collapse, perhaps it would be wise to consider the option of unifying with Germany. Their strength would surely bring stability to our nation."
austria.31.a:0 "We cannot handle this on our own; unify with Germany!"
austria.31.b:0 "There is no need."
